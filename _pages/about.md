I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm) at Tsinghua University, supervised by Professor  [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com/). 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [School of Statistics](https://stat.ecnu.edu.cn/) at East China Normal University (2020–2025). In the early stage of my Ph.D. (2020–2022), I was initially under the supervision of Professor [Dongchu Sun](https://stat.missouri.edu/people/sun-0) before his retirement, after which Professor [Yong Zhou](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s35/zy2_10150/main.psp) became my advisor and directed all of my doctoral research (2022–2025). During the fourth year of my Ph.D., I also spent one year as a joint-training Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore, supervised by Professor [Jialiang Li](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/jialiang/). 

Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Finance, from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.scu.edu.cn/) at Sichuan University (2016–2020).

My research interests focus  on: 

- Precision Medicine
- Data Integration
- Causal Inference
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

If you are interested in any aspect of my work, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Please feel free to contact me via e-mail: xtli@tsinghua.edu.cn.
