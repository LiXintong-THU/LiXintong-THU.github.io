I am a final year PhD candidate in statistics at Guanghua School of Management of [Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/statistic), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](http://songxichen.com). 

My research interests lie broadly in statistics and machine learning theories, and I am also actively involved in interdisciplinary studies. Some specifics are below:

- Statistical and machine learning theory
- Segmented and threshold regression
- Semiparametric and nonparametric statistics
- Transfer learning and causal inference
- Applications to epidemiology and geoscience

My [CV](http://hanyan-stat.github.io/files/CV-HY-2024-10.pdf) can be downloaded here. Please feel free to contact me via [hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn](hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn).
