I am a final year PhD candidate in statistics at Guanghua School of Management of [Peking University], fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](http://songxichen.com). 

I am broadly interested in statistics and machine learning theories, and also actively involved in interdisciplinary studies. Some specifics are below:

{% comment %} 
* **Non-regular statistical models.** Address computational and theoretical challenges of non-regular models, including segmented and threshold regression. 
* **Statistical machine learning.** Develop new methods and statistical guarantees for machine learning topics, such as transfer learning and domain generalization.  
* **Interdisciplinary studies.** Applications in epidemiology and geoscience.

- Segmented/threshold regression
- Semiparametric and nonparametric statistics
- Deep learning and tree-based methods 
- Transfer learning and domain generalization
- Epidemic Modeling

My [CV](http://hanyan-stat.github.io/files/CV_HanYan.pdf) can be downloaded here. Please feel free to contact me via [hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn](hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn). 

**I am on the 2024-2025 academia job market and happy to discuss any opportunities!**
