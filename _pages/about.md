About Me
------------------------
Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a final year PhD candidate in statistics at Peking University, fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](http://songxichen.com). 

I am broadly interested in statistics and machine learning theories. Some specifics are below:

* **Non-regular statistical models.** Address computational and theoretical challenges of non-regular models, including segmented and threshold regression. 
* **Statistical machine learning.** New methods and statistical guarantees for machine learning topics, such as transfer learning and domain generalization.  
* **Interdisciplinary studies.** Applications in epidemiology and geoscience. 

My [CV](http://hanyan-stat.github.io/files/CV_HanYan.pdf) can be downloaded here. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more about my research.

**I am on the 2024-2025 job market looking for full-time academia positions. I am happy to discuss any opportunities!**
