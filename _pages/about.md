I am a final year PhD candidate in statistics at Guanghua School of Management of [Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/statistic), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](http://songxichen.com). 

I am broadly interested in statistics and machine learning theories, and also actively involved in interdisciplinary studies. Some specifics are below:

- Segmented/threshold regression
- Semiparametric and nonparametric statistics
- Deep learning and tree-based methods 
- Transfer learning and domain generalization
- Epidemic Modeling

My [CV](http://hanyan-stat.github.io/files/CV_HanYan.pdf) can be downloaded here. Please feel free to contact me via [hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn](hanyan@stu.pku.edu.cn).
